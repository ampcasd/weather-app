# Weather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

## Development server

Run `docker build -t weather:dev .` and then `docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules -p 4201:4200 --rm weather:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`. The app won't automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Don't run `ng test` as there is no unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Neither `ng e2e` to execute no end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
